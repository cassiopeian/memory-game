## Introduction

 ![Homepage screenshot](images/read-me/homepage.png "Homepage screenshot")

 Do you have the recall of an elephant, or are you more of a goldfish? Test your retention skills with [Millennial Memory Game](https://cassiopeian.github.io/memory-game/).

## Features

 ### Accessibility

 <img src="images/read-me/tile-glow.png" style="width: 75%">

 The game tiles glow white when they’re clicked, and your most recently clicked tile will remain glowing even after it returns to its facedown state.

 If you’d prefer to play without a mouse, you can also tab through the game tiles, and use the white glow as a navigation aide.

 The *Reset* and *Settings* icon buttons are also keyboard focusable.

 ### Two Themes

 To choose between the Lifestyle Trends and Lucky Cats game themes, click the cogwheel icon.

 ### Progress at a Glance

 Watch the green progress bar grow, each time you find a matching pair. To the left of the progress bar, you can also track exactly how many matches you’ve made, out of ten.

## Favicon
